LAP 1 Code Challenge
As you have all been developing for a few weeks now, we can assume we are familiar with Google! So, letâ€™s dive into it a bit more and rebuild it. Try to make this look as much like Google as possible, use your developer tools skills to get some hints!
You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

Requirements
Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.
NB: You are creating your own API. It is up to you if you want to make use of the Google Search API in addition but it is not a requirement
